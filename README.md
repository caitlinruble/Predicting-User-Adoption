# Predicting-User-Adoption
This project used ML to identify which factors predict future user adoption of an online service.

This was a mock take home assessment, with data and business case prompt provided.


I cleaned the data, defined a function to identify which users were "adopted" (defined as logging in 3 times within any 7 day period), engineered new features, scaled and split the data, and finally modeled using an XGBoost Tree Classifier.
